# final-project
# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

#Mario game, a verison of flappy bird, a version of temple run 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

#Elva Li and Angelina Gao 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

#No

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pong 2.0

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that lets you play pong but with a twist. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will preform the game of pong with some new feautres added to it. It will have different features such as hitting a certain spot on the paddle will result in the game speeding up, along with everytime the game speeds up the colors will change. We will execute the game using the server love by coding it in visual studio code 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Angelina Gao - tuk59954@temple.edu, Chong Li
Elva Li- tuk84696@temple.edu Tamara Katic

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be the group successfully designing the game of Pong and having it run without any problems

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be successfully designing the game including one of the two changes we wanted to make and having it run smoothly

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be successfully designing the game including both of the changes we were planning on making and having the game run smoothly

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Through this project, we will acquire the ability to code with the love server as well as program something that involves graphics and movement. We will need to research the details of how to implement and any special functions in love as well as do a little research on the original game Pong as well. Since we are working in a group of 3, Elva will be looking into how to use Love and Haley and Angelina will research how to code Pong and as a team we will look at how to add the implementations into the game.
